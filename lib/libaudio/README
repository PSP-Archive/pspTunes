Audio.h/c Always required(base library)(libs -lpspaudio -lpspaudiocodec -lpsppower)

AudioMPEG.h/c AudioMAD.c mpeg audio(libs -lm)
add -DSANE to CFLAGS in your makefile to exclude AudioMAD

AudioAt3.h/c atrac audio(libs -lpspatrac3) 

AudioFLAC.h/c flac audio(libs -lflac -lm (-logg if built with ogg support)) 
add -DOGG_FLAC to CFLAGS in makefile for ogg-flac support

AudioOGG.h/c ogg audio(requires -lvorbisfile -lvorbis -logg(or -lvorbisidec if built wtih libTremor)) 
add -DOGG_FLAC to CFLAGS in makefile for ogg-flac support

AudioWMA.h/c wma (libs -lpspasfparser) MeBootStart.prx

AudioMUSIC.h/c midi (libs -ltimidity -lm)
